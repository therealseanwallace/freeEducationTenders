        "description": "Northumberland County Council seek to establish a Flexible Purchasing System (FPS) to support the provision of Alternative Education for children of statutory school age.  Alternative Education refers to the operation of programmes of learning and skills development in non-school settings with the aim of supporting the progression of students who have become disengaged or are at risk of being disengaged from school-based education. There will be an emphasis on students being provided with the opportunity to achieve academic accreditation, particularly in English and maths.\nAll lots relate to pre 16 statutory education unless otherwise stated.\nDuring summer 2022 the DfE launched a call for evidence into understanding the use of unregistered alternative provision across England. This was announced as one of the commitments published in the SEND and Alternative Provision green paper which committed to strengthening protections for children in unregistered alternative provision. At the same time the impact of COVID is now starting to show within Northumberland resulting in a rise in both permanent exclusions and fixed term exclusions/suspensions. A FPS will create a more flexible solution providing the Council with improved access to suppliers in order to meet need.\nA provider information and engagement event is scheduled to be held as follows:\nThursday 9th March 2.30 - 4.00 pm\nRoom CR1, Northumberland County Council, Morpeth, Northumberland, NE61 2EF\nPlease register your place at this event by contacting Karen Davison on telephone number 01670 623960 or email: Karen.Davison01@northumberland.gov.uk",

This presents an exciting opportunity for a suitably experienced and innovative partner to enter into a joint venture (\"JV\") with Manchester Met to realise its ambitions for the EISC. At this point in the process, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic in respect of the form which the JV will take (e.g. contractual/incorporated), and is therefore interested to hear bidders’ proposals on this aspect later in the process.  The JV Partner will be responsible for the operational running of the EISC, delivering programmes, promoting the EISC, recruitment of international students, administration of admissions and provide teaching services within the EISC.",

            "description": "Manchester Met’s vision is to collaborate with a JV Partner to create a fully embedded EISC on campus which provides pathway programmes for international students progressing onto Manchester Met degree courses. The EISC will support the University's ambition to significantly increase the number of international students enrolling on Manchester Met degree courses.To achieve this vision, it is envisaged that the EISC will: -be established in partnership with a private provider/partner; -be managed by Manchester Met and the Partner; -be physically embedded on Manchester Met’s campus; and -be established such that the EISC students will have appropriate rights and access to the University's facilities (e.g., library, laboratories, studios, classrooms and accommodation It is envisaged that in the short to medium term the EISC will be based in either existing University facilities or in leased space close to the campus. Led by the growth prospects of the JV, longer term purpose built/renovated facilities will be provided to accommodate such growth on or near to campus. It is intended that the relationship will facilitate a successful collaboration between the two entities, creating a true partnership with the shared ambition of maximising the success of the EISC. To realise this, the parties will enter into a JV following contract award – the form of which will be discussed during the procurement process. As explained above, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic at this point in respect of whether the JV will be based on a contractual or incorporated model. Therefore, to assist bidders in their assessment of this opportunity, Manchester Met has provided a document which lists its ‘key commercial principles’ upon which this arrangement will be based (a copy of which is provided in the procurement documents, available via the Portal). What will the JV Partner bring? Expertise in successfully delivering embedded colleges for other further education institutions and the drive, determination and innovation to ensure that the EISC is at the forefront of the international student market.  What will Manchester Met bring? The facilities required to operate the EISC, support the JV Partner to maximise its success and aims to create a true partnership which optimises the benefits for both parties. The first stage of this process requires bidders to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\u008fSQ\u008f), a copy of which is provided via the Portal. This will enable Manchester Met to identify providers who have the requisite level of experience in delivering similar projects, and the required levels of capability to deliver the EISC. Key areas of importance which will be assessed throughout the process include facilitating a supportive environment for students which maximises their educational success, academic experience, marketing of the EISC, increasing the number of international students who will eventually enrol for degree courses at Manchester Met, realising social value, IT/Systems maturity and facilitating innovation throughout the lifetime of the contract.  Following the evaluation of all SQ responses, Manchester Met intends to identify a maximum of 5 bidders to invite to the invitation to negotiate (ITN) stage of the procurement process. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated and the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated by Manchester Met with the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. At this stage Manchester Met intends to undertake the negotiation phase such that areas for negotiation are focussed, in accordance with its ambition to undertake an efficient but fair and robust process.  A copy of the procurement pack which provides further information about this opportunity is available for download via the Portal.",

These workers will support front line police officers in decision making (upskilling) around Domestic Abuse perpetrators.\n2.\tCARA Delivery - provide resources to work with the Hampton Trust to deliver Project CARA across Cheshire as an intervention for domestic abuse offenders, both male and female who have received a Conditional Caution (soon to be Diversionary Caution).\nThe PCC has submitted a grant application to the Home Office to secure funds to deliver this programme in Cheshire. The submission deadline for the application is 17th February 2023. It is expected a decision on the application will be made by 31st March 2023. In the event we are not successful in our grant application for funding, a contract will not be awarded as a result of this procurement process.\nDue to the sensitive nature of this work, inherent risks working with perpetrators of domestic abuse and the requirement to have appropriately trained and skilled staff available in short timescales, we expect the successful bidder will have some existing links to the Cheshire and North West area. We would also expect they have extensive experience in this area; in safeguarding requirements and will have a proven track record in delivering successful outcomes.\nThe proposed budget for this initial programme (3-year term) is £1.45m.\nIt is expected that the PCC will be able to put a further grant application into the Home Office for a continuation of the funding after the 3 years.

            "description": "Academy trustees have a huge opportunity to make a positive impact on children and young people’s futures by supporting academy trusts to be high quality through effective and robust governance. Academy trust boards need skilled trustees to uphold the charitable objects of the trust, oversee the strategic direction, and hold the executive to account for educational performance, and financial and risk management. Academy trust governance is modelled on charitable company governance, and boards need volunteers with the expertise and commitment required for effective governance of large charitable organisations. \n The contractor will recruit academy trustees, including chairs of trustees, onto academy trust boards that have been identified by Department for Education (DfE) Regional Directors’ teams. These will be academy trusts that are experiencing significant challenges with financial or educational performance and need additional experienced, high calibre individuals to join the board and improve the governance of the trust.   \nThe successful contractor will also promote awareness of the role of academy trustee to target audiences to increase the supply of volunteers for trustee vacancies more broadly. This activity will be complemented by DfE communications and stakeholder engagement activity. \nThis procurement is subject to financial business planning, and the DfE reserves the right to not procure the services outlined below following the conclusion of this review. \n\n          \nIt is expected that the contractor will, as a minimum, need to:   \n•\tIdentify and recruit suitable, high calibre, skilled volunteers in England who have the commitment to serve on academy trust boards, whilst prioritising support to those boards most in need, in areas of the country where capacity is weakest. \n•\tEnsure the volunteer pool is wide enough to support academy trusts in securing diversity of their boards. Trusts of a religious nature may need to recruit people who meet certain faith requirements. \n•\tEnsure that volunteers understand the roles and responsibilities of a trustee, and the time commitment required, particularly in academy trusts experiencing significant financial/educational challenges, in advance of their accepting a position on a board. \n•\tWork effectively with DfE Regional Directors’ teams who will identify boards where academy trustees are most needed and put forward those volunteers with the relevant and desirable skills, knowledge, and characteristics to support boards with the challenges they face. \n•\tProvide high quality induction support to all academy trustees recruited through this funded recruitment service. \n•\tWork with stakeholders, employers, and sector bodies to promote and raise awareness of the role of trusteeship to target audiences.\n•\tCollect and report on specified management information data, undertake self-evaluation, and build in continuous improvement throughout the contract lifetime to ensure that findings are fed into delivery on an ongoing basis.\nIndicative Timeline  \nThe DfE will be hosting online market engagement events to summarise the requirement and provide an opportunity for the DfE to test our broader questions around delivery and feasibility. Your organisation can choose to attend either of the following dates:\n23rd February 16:00 – 17:00\n28th February 14:15 – 15:15\nPlease register your interest in attending one of the events via the DfE e-Tendering portal Jaggaer, http://education.app.jaggaer.com, by completing the Market Engagement – Expression of Interest form (Ref – ssq_351), no later than 1pm on 21 February. \nOnce your organisation has expressed their interest in the opportunity, event details and joining instructions will be issued.\nThe procurement is anticipated to be launched later in Spring 2023 with contracts being awarded in Summer 2023, with a view to delivering in Autumn 2023. More information on the procurement process will be provided following market engagement through the ITT. Additional information: This notice is for information only and is not a call for competition. The DfE reserves the right not to enter into a formal procurement process and not award contracts. Accordingly, the DfE will not be liable for any bid cost, expenditure, work, or effort incurred by a provider in acting on the basis of this Prior Information Notice.",

Our vision is safe, effective, and kind nursing and midwifery that improves everyone's health and wellbeing. As the independent regulator of more than 758,000 nursing and midwifery professionals, we have an important role to play in making this a reality. \nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council (the 'NMC') is a statutory body governed primarily by the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 (the 'Order'). The NMC regulates nurses and midwives in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. From January 2019 the NMC started to regulate the new nursing associate profession in England.\nThe NMC is seeking a partner for a 3-year contract to manage the development of the NMC's requirements for the design, development, and maintenance of the test of competence. The NMC may extend the Initial Term for a further period of up to one (1) year in total subject to agreement with the Supplier. \nThe test of competence is designed to assess a candidate's ability to meet the NMC's standards of proficiency and to practise safely, effectively and in accordance with the NMC's Code of Conduct (the 'Code').

            "description": "The aim of this procurement process is to invite bids for the provision of Design, Development & Maintenance of the Test of Competence\nFollowing the PIN published on FTS on 25 October 2022, Notice reference: 2022/S 000-030010 the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is undertaking a competitive tender process under the Open Procedure, in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (the \"Regulations\").\nThe test of competence currently comprises two elements. The first element is a computer based test (the 'CBT') which comprises of a number of multiple choice questions designed to assess applicants' theoretical knowledge and numerical understanding; we allow candidates 3 hours to complete the CBT. The second element is the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (the 'OSCE') which is a practical simulated assessment of the applicants' practical skills and knowledge. The OSCE comprises 10 stations, with a total testing time of approximately 3 hours.  For further information about the Test of Competence, please visit our website:  Test of Competence 2021 - The Nursing and Midwifery Council (https://www.nmc.org.uk/).   \nThe Supplier is required to maintain, review develop test content for the following tests of competence: \n(a)\tA modular test of competence for nurses who trained outside the United Kingdom and whose qualifications have not been assessed as comparable to a qualification awarded in the UK, or who have previously been registered but who do not meet our standards for readmission. The test must comprise of a CBT and an OSCE. Separate tests of competence must be designed for applicants to all four fields of the nursing profession, namely: \n•\tAdult nursing; \n•\tChildren's nursing; \n•\tMental health nursing; \n•\tLearning disability nursing;\n(b)\tA modular test of competence for those applying to the nursing associate part of the register who trained outside England and whose qualifications have not been assessed as comparable to a qualification awarded in England, or who have previously been registered but who do not meet our standards for readmission. The test must comprise of a CBT and an OSCE. \n(c)\tA modular test of competence for midwives who trained outside the United Kingdom and whose qualifications have not been assessed as comparable to a qualification awarded in the UK, or who have previously been registered but who do not meet our standards for readmission.

The aptitude test must be designed so that applicants can be tested by taking all or part of the test of competence for nurses, midwives or nursing associates who trained outside the EU or EEA (see above). The need for this aptitude test is subject to the continued applicability of the Recognition of Qualifications Directive [2005/36/EC].

        "description": "Subject to sufficient market interest, DWP is considering tendering for a new drug and alcohol dependency Peer Mentoring Trial in Scotland (minimum of four (4) peer mentors covering the Glasgow City area) and Wales (minimum of three (3) peer mentors covering Wrexham, Rhyl and Denbighshire).  The Trial is already being implemented in the wider London, Portsmouth, Liverpool City and Hull regions.\nWe are holding an information session for interested providers on 8 February 2023.  If you would like to attend, please register your interest by email to centralmailbox.drugandalcoholpolicy@DWP.gov.uk  and include email addresses for your attendees (maximum of two (2) per supplier).\nEmployment makes an important contribution to gaining and sustaining recovery from a substance dependency.  However, it can be difficult for Jobcentre Plus to support individuals with an addiction.  Individuals are often unwilling to disclose their dependency to Work Coaches due to denial, shame or fear that they may be sanctioned in some way.  Other individuals with a dependency may not be engaged with DWP at all.  As a result, individuals are not able to receive the help and support they need to overcome their tendency and move towards or in to work.\nPeer Mentors will work in partnership with Jobcentre Plus staff and use their lived experience to support individuals disclose their dependency, access appropriate support (including treatment, housing and financial services) and move towards employment. Peer Mentor support will include holding a minimum of eight (8) face-to-face sessions with Mentees; conducting a diagnostic interview with Mentees to identify their needs and barriers; producing a SMART action plan for each Mentee; acting as an advocate for recovery and supporting Mentees carry out steps from their action plan such as helping them navigate various services, encouraging them to engage in training or employment opportunities.\nProviders will be required to demonstrate a track record of engaging with drug and alcohol dependents and treatment services; recruit Peer Mentors with lived experience of drug or alcohol dependency; suitably train Peer Mentors in supporting Mentees with complex needs; implement appropriate structures to manage, supervise and safeguard Peer Mentors and Mentees; deliver the provision in a location which is accessible to customers from the dedicated Jobcentre Plus offices; and raise awareness of the Peer Mentoring Trial through new and existing relationships and networks.\nInterested providers will need to hold ISO27001 and Cyber Essentials certification and be accredited on the DWP Test and Learn Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) under the Peer Support service line in order to be invited to submit a tender for this opportunity.  Please see the link below for more information:\nDWP Test and Learn Dynamic Purchasing System: guidance for businesses - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)",

Alternative Education refers to the operation of programmes of learning and skills development in non-school settings with the aim of supporting the progression of students who have become disengaged or are at risk of being disengaged from school-based education. There will be an emphasis on students being provided with the opportunity to achieve academic accreditation, particularly in English and maths.\nAll lots relate to pre 16 statutory education unless otherwise stated.\nDuring summer 2022 the DfE launched a call for evidence into understanding the use of unregistered alternative provision across England. This was announced as one of the commitments published in the SEND and Alternative Provision green paper which committed to strengthening protections for children in unregistered alternative provision. At the same time the impact of COVID is now starting to show within Northumberland resulting in a rise in both permanent exclusions and fixed term exclusions/suspensions. A FPS will create a more flexible solution providing the Council with improved access to suppliers in order to meet need.\nA provider information and engagement event is scheduled to be held as follows:\nThursday 9th March 2.30 - 4.00 pm\nRoom CR1, Northumberland County Council, Morpeth, Northumberland, NE61 2EF\nPlease register your place at this event by contacting Karen Davison on telephone number 01670 623960 or email: Karen.Davison01@northumberland.gov.uk",

            "description": "Academy trustees have a huge opportunity to make a positive impact on children and young people’s futures by supporting academy trusts to be high quality through effective and robust governance. Academy trust boards need skilled trustees to uphold the charitable objects of the trust, oversee the strategic direction, and hold the executive to account for educational performance, and financial and risk management. Academy trust governance is modelled on charitable company governance, and boards need volunteers with the expertise and commitment required for effective governance of large charitable organisations. \n The contractor will recruit academy trustees, including chairs of trustees, onto academy trust boards that have been identified by Department for Education (DfE) Regional Directors’ teams. These will be academy trusts that are experiencing significant challenges with financial or educational performance and need additional experienced, high calibre individuals to join the board and improve the governance of the trust.   \nThe successful contractor will also promote awareness of the role of academy trustee to target audiences to increase the supply of volunteers for trustee vacancies more broadly. This activity will be complemented by DfE communications and stakeholder engagement activity. \nThis procurement is subject to financial business planning, and the DfE reserves the right to not procure the services outlined below following the conclusion of this review. \n\n          \nIt is expected that the contractor will, as a minimum, need to:   \n•\tIdentify and recruit suitable, high calibre, skilled volunteers in England who have the commitment to serve on academy trust boards, whilst prioritising support to those boards most in need, in areas of the country where capacity is weakest. \n•\tEnsure the volunteer pool is wide enough to support academy trusts in securing diversity of their boards. Trusts of a religious nature may need to recruit people who meet certain faith requirements. \n•\tEnsure that volunteers understand the roles and responsibilities of a trustee, and the time commitment required, particularly in academy trusts experiencing significant financial/educational challenges, in advance of their accepting a position on a board. \n•\tWork effectively with DfE Regional Directors’ teams who will identify boards where academy trustees are most needed and put forward those volunteers with the relevant and desirable skills, knowledge, and characteristics to support boards with the challenges they face. \n•\tProvide high quality induction support to all academy trustees recruited through this funded recruitment service. \n•\tWork with stakeholders, employers, and sector bodies to promote and raise awareness of the role of trusteeship to target audiences.\n•\tCollect and report on specified management information data, undertake self-evaluation, and build in continuous improvement throughout the contract lifetime to ensure that findings are fed into delivery on an ongoing basis.\nIndicative Timeline  \nThe DfE will be hosting online market engagement events to summarise the requirement and provide an opportunity for the DfE to test our broader questions around delivery and feasibility. Your organisation can choose to attend either of the following dates:\n23rd February 16:00 – 17:00\n28th February 14:15 – 15:15\nPlease register your interest in attending one of the events via the DfE e-Tendering portal Jaggaer, http://education.app.jaggaer.com, by completing the Market Engagement – Expression of Interest form (Ref – ssq_351), no later than 1pm on 21 February. \nOnce your organisation has expressed their interest in the opportunity, event details and joining instructions will be issued.\nThe procurement is anticipated to be launched later in Spring 2023 with contracts being awarded in Summer 2023, with a view to delivering in Autumn 2023. More information on the procurement process will be provided following market engagement through the ITT.

Where children and young people can transition back into mainstream provision or onto a post 16 pathway, we are making it clear that alternative provision is a short-term intervention for re-engagement and support, that it is not a destination.\nThe Framework shall comprise of the following Lots:\n1 Ofsted registered Alternative Provision\n2 Inclusion support\n3 Re-engagement\n4 Teaching\n5 Progress to settled adulthood\nThe Council’s new delivery model is in line with the broad direction of the government’s published proposals for SEND and alternative provision; it will however require changes to respond to the national requirements which are likely to be in around 2 years’ time. A framework length of 2 years plus an optional 2 x 1 year extension, and a clear expectation in the tender that providers will respond to future national changes, provides the ability for Dorset Council to make changes as required. The Framework will run from September 2022.\nTenderers may apply to enter this Open Framework at any time during the period of the Framework and the Council will evaluate applications each school term ahead of any call-off requirements.\nEducational establishments in the Dorset Council area may access and call-off from the framework using Lot 2 only. This includes all schools maintained by Local Authorities, Academies, Special Schools and Pupil Referral Units as listed here: Schools and Academies Search Results | Dorset FID (dorsetcouncil.gov.uk). https://familyinformationdirectory.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk/kb5/dorset/fsd/results.page?familychannel=301&sortfield=title&sorttype=field&term\nThere is no limit on suppliers that will be admitted to the Framework.",

This contract notice is to advise providers the first round of applications to join the DPS has been completed and new childcare providers can join this arrangement at any time for the validity period of the Dynamic Purchasing System.\nThe Council is looking to engage with suitably experienced and qualified childcare providers to provide\nLot 1 - Early Years\nLot 2 - Flying Start\nLot 3 - Assisted Places and Supported Places\nSuitably qualified childcare providers are able to tender for one or more lots.\nThis DPS shall replace an existing arrangement for the provision of Childcare PS1609/17/HS, which is due to expire on the 31 March 2023.  Service Providers currently awarded to the existing arrangement (PS1609) must apply to join the new DPS arrangement. The existing arrangement shall be terminated when all service providers have joined the new DPS arrangement, which must happen prior to the 31 March 2023 when the existing arrangement shall naturally come to an end. The Council reserves the right to terminate the existing arrangement end date at its own discretion. Service providers who have not successfully joined this DPS arrangement by such a time will not be utilised by the Council until they have successfully joined the DPS for the provision of childcare (DPS1003584).\nFor the purpose of this arrangement, the term ‘childcare provision’ will be used for the non-maintained sector including Playgroups, Cylchoedd Meithrin, Day Nurseries, Childminders, Out of School provision in both Welsh medium and English medium, including Wrap around, before and after school provision.\nService Providers who satisfy the criteria to their application to join this arrangement shall be subject to relevant inspection methods depending on the area of work as set out in the ITT and by Early Years Officers.\nAll costs and charges are set by the Council.  All lots are subject to the Council successfully attaining grants and ongoing levels of funding each year.  Early Years shall inform Service Providers the ongoing costs and charges at the being of the financial year.\nThe validity of the DPS is from the 01 February 2023 to 31 January 2029 with the option to extend for up to a further period of forty-eight (48) months\nFull details are provided within the initiation to tender (ITT) documentation",

The Flying Start programme is Welsh Government funded.\nThe Flying Start childcare provision will be provided for children who live in the Flying Start postcode catchment areas from the term after their second birthday until the term of their third birthday, to enable smooth transition into their rising 3 place in Early Years Education.\nWelsh Government Flying Start Guidance states that Childcare is required to run 5 days for 2.5 hours a day for 39 weeks a year (term time) with some Council and setting discretion for flexibility where parents are attending training or working. Settings should be able to offer some flexibility for no more than 2 sessions per day, but this arrangement is exceptional and must be agreed by the Council in advance of the offer being made to the family. Any arrangements made without prior Council approval of placement, will be the responsibility of the setting to finance.\nIdeally Childcare provision (which includes sessional, day care and childminding settings), should be within a 15 minute walking distance of the Flying Start designated areas. A map of Current Flying Start Areas is included at Annex 1 (of the ITT), however, the number of areas on the list is likely to increase as the programme expands.\nFull detail are in the ITT Additional information: Full Details can be found in the Initiation to tender (ITT) documents\nPlease note that there is an option to extend the DPS for up to a further period of forty-eight (48) months\nPlease note that the estimated value includes the extension period",

The Assisted and/or Supported placement (herein after called the ‘placement’), will provide targeted intervention to identify the child’s needs in readiness for when they start Nursery.\nAn Assisted Place provides a set amount of funding to pay for the place at the childcare setting.\nA Supported Place provides a set amount of funding for a specified period of time for the childcare setting to release staff to undertake targeted intervention work to support the child’s development within the childcare setting.\nFunding supports children in registered childcare settings which have agreed with us to deliver Assisted and Supported Places.\nChildren with emerging needs would be supported either by the Portage team in Aneurin Bevan University Health Board or Join in and Play (JIAP) team in Caerphilly CBC. If a Childcare setting is caring for a child who may have emerging needs / developmental delays where the family is not receiving support, a Request for Support*1 can be made.\nThe placement provides time limited support for a term, for children who are likely to be identified through the Portage team or Join in and Play team. There may be occasions when children with emerging needs are identified by other professionals, but the Council aims to support children with emerging developmental delays long before they start an Assisted or Supported placement.\nChildren would be referred to our Early Years Emerging Needs Panel*2 for discussion and a decision on the type and length of a childcare placement in the term prior to starting the childcare placement. The key worker for the family would be responsible for submitting the Emerging Needs Support Form*3 to the Emerging Needs Panel and would be a key link for the childcare setting moving forward. The childcare setting is expected to link with the key worker for the family on an ongoing basis. The funded placement would be for up to 3 sessions per week for a term and in exceptional circumstances for up to 2 terms, prior to starting Nursery. Session days and times may vary but would be expected to be 3hours per session for 3 sessions per week or 2 sessions for a longer duration.\nAdditional support (staff time) for a childcare placement would be decided by the Emerging Needs panel, based on the child’s needs that have been presented to the Emerging Needs panel from the paperwork submitted, and would be to support specific interventions during the session the child attends.\nFull detail are in the ITT Additional information: Full Details can be found in the Initiation to tender (ITT) documents\nPlease note that there is an option to extend the DPS for up to a further period of forty-eight (48) months\nPlease note that the estimated value includes the extension period",

This contract notice is to advise providers the first round of applications to join the DPS has been completed and new childcare providers can join this arrangement at any time for the validity period of the Dynamic Purchasing System.\nThe Council is looking to engage with suitably experienced and qualified childcare providers to provide\nLot 1 - Early Years\nLot 2 - Flying Start\nLot 3 - Assisted Places and Supported Places\nSuitably qualified childcare providers are able to tender for one or more lots.\nThis DPS shall replace an existing arrangement for the provision of Childcare PS1609/17/HS, which is due to expire on the 31 March 2023.  Service Providers currently awarded to the existing arrangement (PS1609) must apply to join the new DPS arrangement. The existing arrangement shall be terminated when all service providers have joined the new DPS arrangement, which must happen prior to the 31 March 2023 when the existing arrangement shall naturally come to an end. The Council reserves the right to terminate the existing arrangement end date at its own discretion. Service providers who have not successfully joined this DPS arrangement by such a time will not be utilised by the Council until they have successfully joined the DPS for the provision of childcare (DPS1003584).\nFor the purpose of this arrangement, the term ‘childcare provision’ will be used for the non-maintained sector including Playgroups, Cylchoedd Meithrin, Day Nurseries, Childminders, Out of School provision in both Welsh medium and English medium, including Wrap around, before and after school provision.\nService Providers who satisfy the criteria to their application to join this arrangement shall be subject to relevant inspection methods depending on the area of work as set out in the ITT and by Early Years Officers.\nAll costs and charges are set by the Council.  All lots are subject to the Council successfully attaining grants and ongoing levels of funding each year.  Early Years shall inform Service Providers the ongoing costs and charges at the being of the financial year.\nThe validity of the DPS is from the 01 February 2023 to 31 January 2029 with the option to extend for up to a further period of forty-eight (48) months\nFull details are provided within the initiation to tender (ITT) documentation",

The Flying Start programme is Welsh Government funded.\nThe Flying Start childcare provision will be provided for children who live in the Flying Start postcode catchment areas from the term after their second birthday until the term of their third birthday, to enable smooth transition into their rising 3 place in Early Years Education.\nWelsh Government Flying Start Guidance states that Childcare is required to run 5 days for 2.5 hours a day for 39 weeks a year (term time) with some Council and setting discretion for flexibility where parents are attending training or working. Settings should be able to offer some flexibility for no more than 2 sessions per day, but this arrangement is exceptional and must be agreed by the Council in advance of the offer being made to the family. Any arrangements made without prior Council approval of placement, will be the responsibility of the setting to finance.\nIdeally Childcare provision (which includes sessional, day care and childminding settings), should be within a 15 minute walking distance of the Flying Start designated areas. A map of Current Flying Start Areas is included at Annex 1 (of the ITT), however, the number of areas on the list is likely to increase as the programme expands.\nFull detail are in the ITT Additional information: Full Details can be found in the Initiation to tender (ITT) documents\nPlease note that there is an option to extend the DPS for up to a further period of forty-eight (48) months\nPlease note that the estimated value includes the extension period",

The Assisted and/or Supported placement (herein after called the ‘placement’), will provide targeted intervention to identify the child’s needs in readiness for when they start Nursery.\nAn Assisted Place provides a set amount of funding to pay for the place at the childcare setting.\nA Supported Place provides a set amount of funding for a specified period of time for the childcare setting to release staff to undertake targeted intervention work to support the child’s development within the childcare setting.\nFunding supports children in registered childcare settings which have agreed with us to deliver Assisted and Supported Places.\nChildren with emerging needs would be supported either by the Portage team in Aneurin Bevan University Health Board or Join in and Play (JIAP) team in Caerphilly CBC. If a Childcare setting is caring for a child who may have emerging needs / developmental delays where the family is not receiving support, a Request for Support*1 can be made.\nThe placement provides time limited support for a term, for children who are likely to be identified through the Portage team or Join in and Play team. There may be occasions when children with emerging needs are identified by other professionals, but the Council aims to support children with emerging developmental delays long before they start an Assisted or Supported placement.\nChildren would be referred to our Early Years Emerging Needs Panel*2 for discussion and a decision on the type and length of a childcare placement in the term prior to starting the childcare placement. The key worker for the family would be responsible for submitting the Emerging Needs Support Form*3 to the Emerging Needs Panel and would be a key link for the childcare setting moving forward. The childcare setting is expected to link with the key worker for the family on an ongoing basis. The funded placement would be for up to 3 sessions per week for a term and in exceptional circumstances for up to 2 terms, prior to starting Nursery. Session days and times may vary but would be expected to be 3hours per session for 3 sessions per week or 2 sessions for a longer duration.\nAdditional support (staff time) for a childcare placement would be decided by the Emerging Needs panel, based on the child’s needs that have been presented to the Emerging Needs panel from the paperwork submitted, and would be to support specific interventions during the session the child attends.\nFull detail are in the ITT Additional information: Full Details can be found in the Initiation to tender (ITT) documents\nPlease note that there is an option to extend the DPS for up to a further period of forty-eight (48) months\nPlease note that the estimated value includes the extension period",

            "description": "Academy trustees have a huge opportunity to make a positive impact on children and young people’s futures by supporting academy trusts to be high quality through effective and robust governance. Academy trust boards need skilled trustees to uphold the charitable objects of the trust, oversee the strategic direction, and hold the executive to account for educational performance, and financial and risk management. Academy trust governance is modelled on charitable company governance, and boards need volunteers with the expertise and commitment required for effective governance of large charitable organisations. \n The contractor will recruit academy trustees, including chairs of trustees, onto academy trust boards that have been identified by Department for Education (DfE) Regional Directors’ teams. These will be academy trusts that are experiencing significant challenges with financial or educational performance and need additional experienced, high calibre individuals to join the board and improve the governance of the trust.   \nThe successful contractor will also promote awareness of the role of academy trustee to target audiences to increase the supply of volunteers for trustee vacancies more broadly. This activity will be complemented by DfE communications and stakeholder engagement activity. \nThis procurement is subject to financial business planning, and the DfE reserves the right to not procure the services outlined below following the conclusion of this review. \n\n          \nIt is expected that the contractor will, as a minimum, need to:   \n•\tIdentify and recruit suitable, high calibre, skilled volunteers in England who have the commitment to serve on academy trust boards, whilst prioritising support to those boards most in need, in areas of the country where capacity is weakest. \n•\tEnsure the volunteer pool is wide enough to support academy trusts in securing diversity of their boards. Trusts of a religious nature may need to recruit people who meet certain faith requirements. \n•\tEnsure that volunteers understand the roles and responsibilities of a trustee, and the time commitment required, particularly in academy trusts experiencing significant financial/educational challenges, in advance of their accepting a position on a board. \n•\tWork effectively with DfE Regional Directors’ teams who will identify boards where academy trustees are most needed and put forward those volunteers with the relevant and desirable skills, knowledge, and characteristics to support boards with the challenges they face. \n•\tProvide high quality induction support to all academy trustees recruited through this funded recruitment service. \n•\tWork with stakeholders, employers, and sector bodies to promote and raise awareness of the role of trusteeship to target audiences.\n•\tCollect and report on specified management information data, undertake self-evaluation, and build in continuous improvement throughout the contract lifetime to ensure that findings are fed into delivery on an ongoing basis.\nIndicative Timeline  \nThe DfE will be hosting online market engagement events to summarise the requirement and provide an opportunity for the DfE to test our broader questions around delivery and feasibility. Your organisation can choose to attend either of the following dates:\n23rd February 16:00 – 17:00\n28th February 14:15 – 15:15\nPlease register your interest in attending one of the events via the DfE e-Tendering portal Jaggaer, http://education.app.jaggaer.com, by completing the Market Engagement – Expression of Interest form (Ref – ssq_351), no later than 1pm on 21 February. \nOnce your organisation has expressed their interest in the opportunity, event details and joining instructions will be issued.\nThe procurement is anticipated to be launched later in Spring 2023 with contracts being awarded in Summer 2023, with a view to delivering in Autumn 2023. More information on the procurement process will be provided following market engagement through the ITT.

We support children and young people through a focus on the best education for all our children and young people, our localities model and inclusion within our mainstream educational settings.\nThe Framework will ensure that Dorset Council is able to arrange suitable education or training provision for children and young people where it is needed. The need for such provision can arise for a number of reasons, including those set out under the government definition of Alternative provision: education arranged by local authorities for pupils who, because of exclusion, illness, or other reasons, would not otherwise receive suitable education; education arranged by schools for pupils on a fixed period exclusion; and where support is required for behavioural or other needs.\nThis Framework is part of a new model of alternative provision, where such provision is used where it is needed, and is high quality enabling children and young people to make progress. Where children and young people can transition back into mainstream provision or onto a post 16 pathway, we are making it clear that alternative provision is a short-term intervention for re-engagement and support, that it is not a destination.\nThe Framework shall comprise of the following Lots:\n1 Ofsted registered Alternative Provision\n2 Inclusion support\n3 Re-engagement\n4 Teaching\n5 Progress to settled adulthood\nThe Council’s new delivery model is in line with the broad direction of the government’s published proposals for SEND and alternative provision; it will however require changes to respond to the national requirements which are likely to be in around 2 years’ time. A framework length of 2 years plus an optional 2 x 1 year extension, and a clear expectation in the tender that providers will respond to future national changes, provides the ability for Dorset Council to make changes as required.

This presents an exciting opportunity for a suitably experienced and innovative partner to enter into a joint venture (\"JV\") with Manchester Met to realise its ambitions for the EISC. At this point in the process, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic in respect of the form which the JV will take (e.g. contractual/incorporated), and is therefore interested to hear bidders’ proposals on this aspect later in the process.  The JV Partner will be responsible for the operational running of the EISC, delivering programmes, promoting the EISC, recruitment of international students, administration of admissions and provide teaching services within the EISC.",

            "description": "Manchester Met’s vision is to collaborate with a JV Partner to create a fully embedded EISC on campus which provides pathway programmes for international students progressing onto Manchester Met degree courses. The EISC will support the University's ambition to significantly increase the number of international students enrolling on Manchester Met degree courses.To achieve this vision, it is envisaged that the EISC will: -be established in partnership with a private provider/partner; -be managed by Manchester Met and the Partner; -be physically embedded on Manchester Met’s campus; and -be established such that the EISC students will have appropriate rights and access to the University's facilities (e.g., library, laboratories, studios, classrooms and accommodation It is envisaged that in the short to medium term the EISC will be based in either existing University facilities or in leased space close to the campus. Led by the growth prospects of the JV, longer term purpose built/renovated facilities will be provided to accommodate such growth on or near to campus. It is intended that the relationship will facilitate a successful collaboration between the two entities, creating a true partnership with the shared ambition of maximising the success of the EISC. To realise this, the parties will enter into a JV following contract award – the form of which will be discussed during the procurement process. As explained above, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic at this point in respect of whether the JV will be based on a contractual or incorporated model. Therefore, to assist bidders in their assessment of this opportunity, Manchester Met has provided a document which lists its ‘key commercial principles’ upon which this arrangement will be based (a copy of which is provided in the procurement documents, available via the Portal). What will the JV Partner bring? Expertise in successfully delivering embedded colleges for other further education institutions and the drive, determination and innovation to ensure that the EISC is at the forefront of the international student market.  What will Manchester Met bring? The facilities required to operate the EISC, support the JV Partner to maximise its success and aims to create a true partnership which optimises the benefits for both parties. The first stage of this process requires bidders to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\u008fSQ\u008f), a copy of which is provided via the Portal. This will enable Manchester Met to identify providers who have the requisite level of experience in delivering similar projects, and the required levels of capability to deliver the EISC. Key areas of importance which will be assessed throughout the process include facilitating a supportive environment for students which maximises their educational success, academic experience, marketing of the EISC, increasing the number of international students who will eventually enrol for degree courses at Manchester Met, realising social value, IT/Systems maturity and facilitating innovation throughout the lifetime of the contract.  Following the evaluation of all SQ responses, Manchester Met intends to identify a maximum of 5 bidders to invite to the invitation to negotiate (ITN) stage of the procurement process. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated and the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated by Manchester Met with the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase.

            "description": "Academy trustees have a huge opportunity to make a positive impact on children and young people’s futures by supporting academy trusts to be high quality through effective and robust governance. Academy trust boards need skilled trustees to uphold the charitable objects of the trust, oversee the strategic direction, and hold the executive to account for educational performance, and financial and risk management. Academy trust governance is modelled on charitable company governance, and boards need volunteers with the expertise and commitment required for effective governance of large charitable organisations. \n The contractor will recruit academy trustees, including chairs of trustees, onto academy trust boards that have been identified by Department for Education (DfE) Regional Directors’ teams. These will be academy trusts that are experiencing significant challenges with financial or educational performance and need additional experienced, high calibre individuals to join the board and improve the governance of the trust.   \nThe successful contractor will also promote awareness of the role of academy trustee to target audiences to increase the supply of volunteers for trustee vacancies more broadly. This activity will be complemented by DfE communications and stakeholder engagement activity. \nThis procurement is subject to financial business planning, and the DfE reserves the right to not procure the services outlined below following the conclusion of this review. \n\n          \nIt is expected that the contractor will, as a minimum, need to:   \n•\tIdentify and recruit suitable, high calibre, skilled volunteers in England who have the commitment to serve on academy trust boards, whilst prioritising support to those boards most in need, in areas of the country where capacity is weakest. \n•\tEnsure the volunteer pool is wide enough to support academy trusts in securing diversity of their boards. Trusts of a religious nature may need to recruit people who meet certain faith requirements. \n•\tEnsure that volunteers understand the roles and responsibilities of a trustee, and the time commitment required, particularly in academy trusts experiencing significant financial/educational challenges, in advance of their accepting a position on a board. \n•\tWork effectively with DfE Regional Directors’ teams who will identify boards where academy trustees are most needed and put forward those volunteers with the relevant and desirable skills, knowledge, and characteristics to support boards with the challenges they face. \n•\tProvide high quality induction support to all academy trustees recruited through this funded recruitment service. \n•\tWork with stakeholders, employers, and sector bodies to promote and raise awareness of the role of trusteeship to target audiences.\n•\tCollect and report on specified management information data, undertake self-evaluation, and build in continuous improvement throughout the contract lifetime to ensure that findings are fed into delivery on an ongoing basis.\nIndicative Timeline  \nThe DfE will be hosting online market engagement events to summarise the requirement and provide an opportunity for the DfE to test our broader questions around delivery and feasibility. Your organisation can choose to attend either of the following dates:\n23rd February 16:00 – 17:00\n28th February 14:15 – 15:15\nPlease register your interest in attending one of the events via the DfE e-Tendering portal Jaggaer, http://education.app.jaggaer.com, by completing the Market Engagement – Expression of Interest form (Ref – ssq_351), no later than 1pm on 21 February. \nOnce your organisation has expressed their interest in the opportunity, event details and joining instructions will be issued.\nThe procurement is anticipated to be launched later in Spring 2023 with contracts being awarded in Summer 2023, with a view to delivering in Autumn 2023. More information on the procurement process will be provided following market engagement through the ITT. Additional information: This notice is for information only and is not a call for competition. The DfE reserves the right not to enter into a formal procurement process and not award contracts. Accordingly, the DfE will not be liable for any bid cost, expenditure, work, or effort incurred by a provider in acting on the basis of this Prior Information Notice.",

This presents an exciting opportunity for a suitably experienced and innovative partner to enter into a joint venture (\"JV\") with Manchester Met to realise its ambitions for the EISC. At this point in the process, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic in respect of the form which the JV will take (e.g. contractual/incorporated), and is therefore interested to hear bidders’ proposals on this aspect later in the process.  The JV Partner will be responsible for the operational running of the EISC, delivering programmes, promoting the EISC, recruitment of international students, administration of admissions and provide teaching services within the EISC.",

            "description": "Manchester Met’s vision is to collaborate with a JV Partner to create a fully embedded EISC on campus which provides pathway programmes for international students progressing onto Manchester Met degree courses. The EISC will support the University's ambition to significantly increase the number of international students enrolling on Manchester Met degree courses.To achieve this vision, it is envisaged that the EISC will: -be established in partnership with a private provider/partner; -be managed by Manchester Met and the Partner; -be physically embedded on Manchester Met’s campus; and -be established such that the EISC students will have appropriate rights and access to the University's facilities (e.g., library, laboratories, studios, classrooms and accommodation It is envisaged that in the short to medium term the EISC will be based in either existing University facilities or in leased space close to the campus. Led by the growth prospects of the JV, longer term purpose built/renovated facilities will be provided to accommodate such growth on or near to campus. It is intended that the relationship will facilitate a successful collaboration between the two entities, creating a true partnership with the shared ambition of maximising the success of the EISC. To realise this, the parties will enter into a JV following contract award – the form of which will be discussed during the procurement process. As explained above, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic at this point in respect of whether the JV will be based on a contractual or incorporated model. Therefore, to assist bidders in their assessment of this opportunity, Manchester Met has provided a document which lists its ‘key commercial principles’ upon which this arrangement will be based (a copy of which is provided in the procurement documents, available via the Portal). What will the JV Partner bring? Expertise in successfully delivering embedded colleges for other further education institutions and the drive, determination and innovation to ensure that the EISC is at the forefront of the international student market.  What will Manchester Met bring? The facilities required to operate the EISC, support the JV Partner to maximise its success and aims to create a true partnership which optimises the benefits for both parties. The first stage of this process requires bidders to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\u008fSQ\u008f), a copy of which is provided via the Portal. This will enable Manchester Met to identify providers who have the requisite level of experience in delivering similar projects, and the required levels of capability to deliver the EISC. Key areas of importance which will be assessed throughout the process include facilitating a supportive environment for students which maximises their educational success, academic experience, marketing of the EISC, increasing the number of international students who will eventually enrol for degree courses at Manchester Met, realising social value, IT/Systems maturity and facilitating innovation throughout the lifetime of the contract.  Following the evaluation of all SQ responses, Manchester Met intends to identify a maximum of 5 bidders to invite to the invitation to negotiate (ITN) stage of the procurement process. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated and the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated by Manchester Met with the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. At this stage Manchester Met intends to undertake the negotiation phase such that areas for negotiation are focussed, in accordance with its ambition to undertake an efficient but fair and robust process.  A copy of the procurement pack which provides further information about this opportunity is available for download via the Portal.",

            "description": "Academy trustees have a huge opportunity to make a positive impact on children and young people’s futures by supporting academy trusts to be high quality through effective and robust governance. Academy trust boards need skilled trustees to uphold the charitable objects of the trust, oversee the strategic direction, and hold the executive to account for educational performance, and financial and risk management. Academy trust governance is modelled on charitable company governance, and boards need volunteers with the expertise and commitment required for effective governance of large charitable organisations. \n The contractor will recruit academy trustees, including chairs of trustees, onto academy trust boards that have been identified by Department for Education (DfE) Regional Directors’ teams. These will be academy trusts that are experiencing significant challenges with financial or educational performance and need additional experienced, high calibre individuals to join the board and improve the governance of the trust.   \nThe successful contractor will also promote awareness of the role of academy trustee to target audiences to increase the supply of volunteers for trustee vacancies more broadly. This activity will be complemented by DfE communications and stakeholder engagement activity. \nThis procurement is subject to financial business planning, and the DfE reserves the right to not procure the services outlined below following the conclusion of this review. \n\n          \nIt is expected that the contractor will, as a minimum, need to:   \n•\tIdentify and recruit suitable, high calibre, skilled volunteers in England who have the commitment to serve on academy trust boards, whilst prioritising support to those boards most in need, in areas of the country where capacity is weakest. \n•\tEnsure the volunteer pool is wide enough to support academy trusts in securing diversity of their boards. Trusts of a religious nature may need to recruit people who meet certain faith requirements. \n•\tEnsure that volunteers understand the roles and responsibilities of a trustee, and the time commitment required, particularly in academy trusts experiencing significant financial/educational challenges, in advance of their accepting a position on a board. \n•\tWork effectively with DfE Regional Directors’ teams who will identify boards where academy trustees are most needed and put forward those volunteers with the relevant and desirable skills, knowledge, and characteristics to support boards with the challenges they face. \n•\tProvide high quality induction support to all academy trustees recruited through this funded recruitment service. \n•\tWork with stakeholders, employers, and sector bodies to promote and raise awareness of the role of trusteeship to target audiences.\n•\tCollect and report on specified management information data, undertake self-evaluation, and build in continuous improvement throughout the contract lifetime to ensure that findings are fed into delivery on an ongoing basis.\nIndicative Timeline  \nThe DfE will be hosting online market engagement events to summarise the requirement and provide an opportunity for the DfE to test our broader questions around delivery and feasibility. Your organisation can choose to attend either of the following dates:\n23rd February 16:00 – 17:00\n28th February 14:15 – 15:15\nPlease register your interest in attending one of the events via the DfE e-Tendering portal Jaggaer, http://education.app.jaggaer.com, by completing the Market Engagement – Expression of Interest form (Ref – ssq_351), no later than 1pm on 21 February. \nOnce your organisation has expressed their interest in the opportunity, event details and joining instructions will be issued.\nThe procurement is anticipated to be launched later in Spring 2023 with contracts being awarded in Summer 2023, with a view to delivering in Autumn 2023. More information on the procurement process will be provided following market engagement through the ITT. Additional information: This notice is for information only and is not a call for competition. The DfE reserves the right not to enter into a formal procurement process and not award contracts.

It is envisaged that these contracts will start on 1 August 2023 for an initial period of twelve months covering the 2023/24 academic year, with options to extend further by up to three 12-month periods (extension will depend on factors including individual supplier performance and government spending priorities). \nProviders will need to meet the criteria and quality standards that will be set out in the procurement documents. \nThe contracts awarded through this procurement exercise will be for qualifications-based provision and/or their components described in the AEB funding rules and/or the Free Courses For Jobs (“FCFJ”) offer. \nMultiple providers are sought to deliver the service across the non-devolved regions of England only. This means individual suppliers will be limited to a maximum contract value, referred to as a ‘tender cap’ according to factors including their experience of providing similar services and the size of the bidding organisation.  Note however that the Authority does not guarantee that providers who are successfully appointed will necessarily receive funding in an amount equivalent to their applicable tender cap.\nSeparately to this, an overall maximum contract value of £2.5 million per year will apply (albeit subject to availability of funding/provider performance, the Authority may award funding beyond the afore-mentioned ‘caps’ to providers if/when further funding becomes available and therefore annual contract values may increase in due course).\nFollowing award, contract values may be increased or decreased according to factors including performance by the contractor and government funding priorities as further explained in the procurement documents.\nGiven the duration of the contract, the Authority may (at its absolute discretion) agree to variations in respect of the subject-matter of the courses delivered to the extent that such courses continue to fall within the auspices of adult education and the relevant funding rules as described above.\nThe procurement will be open to providers who are seeking to deliver adult education and training provision funded by the ESFA AEB and FCFJ (and/or any other relevant public sector funding which may become available to deliver adult education programmes from time to time). Providers must deliver such provision in accordance with the then current funding rules applicable to such funding (such that the provision is wholly fundable within the scope of those funding rules). \nThe procurement process will be carried out electronically via Jaggaer, an online e-Procurement Solution portal. Potential bidders should therefore ensure they are registered on this portal, under the name of the legal organisation that intends to enter into a contract deliver the services. It can be accessed via your web browser at https://education.app.jaggaer.com. For full details of the instructions to tenderers and the terms of participation, please refer to the Invitation to Tender documents (including attachments) which are available through Jaggaer.\nThe estimated value of all the contracts to be awarded pursuant to this procurement process is £290,000,000, taking into account all potential extension options and the possibility of further funding becoming available during the lifetime of the contract. Additional information: The Department is planning to host a Bidder Briefing Session on 9 February 2023 hosted via Microsoft Teams. If you would like to attend, please raise a clarification via Jaggaer with the representative’s name, job title and email address.",

This presents an exciting opportunity for a suitably experienced and innovative partner to enter into a joint venture (\"JV\") with Manchester Met to realise its ambitions for the EISC. At this point in the process, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic in respect of the form which the JV will take (e.g. contractual/incorporated), and is therefore interested to hear bidders’ proposals on this aspect later in the process.  The JV Partner will be responsible for the operational running of the EISC, delivering programmes, promoting the EISC, recruitment of international students, administration of admissions and provide teaching services within the EISC.",

            "description": "Manchester Met’s vision is to collaborate with a JV Partner to create a fully embedded EISC on campus which provides pathway programmes for international students progressing onto Manchester Met degree courses. The EISC will support the University's ambition to significantly increase the number of international students enrolling on Manchester Met degree courses.To achieve this vision, it is envisaged that the EISC will: -be established in partnership with a private provider/partner; -be managed by Manchester Met and the Partner; -be physically embedded on Manchester Met’s campus; and -be established such that the EISC students will have appropriate rights and access to the University's facilities (e.g., library, laboratories, studios, classrooms and accommodation It is envisaged that in the short to medium term the EISC will be based in either existing University facilities or in leased space close to the campus. Led by the growth prospects of the JV, longer term purpose built/renovated facilities will be provided to accommodate such growth on or near to campus. It is intended that the relationship will facilitate a successful collaboration between the two entities, creating a true partnership with the shared ambition of maximising the success of the EISC. To realise this, the parties will enter into a JV following contract award – the form of which will be discussed during the procurement process. As explained above, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic at this point in respect of whether the JV will be based on a contractual or incorporated model. Therefore, to assist bidders in their assessment of this opportunity, Manchester Met has provided a document which lists its ‘key commercial principles’ upon which this arrangement will be based (a copy of which is provided in the procurement documents, available via the Portal). What will the JV Partner bring? Expertise in successfully delivering embedded colleges for other further education institutions and the drive, determination and innovation to ensure that the EISC is at the forefront of the international student market.  What will Manchester Met bring? The facilities required to operate the EISC, support the JV Partner to maximise its success and aims to create a true partnership which optimises the benefits for both parties. The first stage of this process requires bidders to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\u008fSQ\u008f), a copy of which is provided via the Portal. This will enable Manchester Met to identify providers who have the requisite level of experience in delivering similar projects, and the required levels of capability to deliver the EISC. Key areas of importance which will be assessed throughout the process include facilitating a supportive environment for students which maximises their educational success, academic experience, marketing of the EISC, increasing the number of international students who will eventually enrol for degree courses at Manchester Met, realising social value, IT/Systems maturity and facilitating innovation throughout the lifetime of the contract.  Following the evaluation of all SQ responses, Manchester Met intends to identify a maximum of 5 bidders to invite to the invitation to negotiate (ITN) stage of the procurement process. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated and the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated by Manchester Met with the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. At this stage Manchester Met intends to undertake the negotiation phase such that areas for negotiation are focussed, in accordance with its ambition to undertake an efficient but fair and robust process.  A copy of the procurement pack which provides further information about this opportunity is available for download via the Portal.",

Our vision is safe, effective, and kind nursing and midwifery that improves everyone's health and wellbeing. As the independent regulator of more than 758,000 nursing and midwifery professionals, we have an important role to play in making this a reality. \nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council (the 'NMC') is a statutory body governed primarily by the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 (the 'Order'). The NMC regulates nurses and midwives in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. From January 2019 the NMC started to regulate the new nursing associate profession in England.\nThe NMC is seeking a partner for a 3-year contract to manage the development of the NMC's requirements for the design, development, and maintenance of the test of competence. The NMC may extend the Initial Term for a further period of up to one (1) year in total subject to agreement with the Supplier. \nThe test of competence is designed to assess a candidate's ability to meet the NMC's standards of proficiency and to practise safely, effectively and in accordance with the NMC's Code of Conduct (the 'Code'). The Code contains the professional standards that NMC registered nurses, midwives and nursing associates must uphold.",

The first element is a computer based test (the 'CBT') which comprises of a number of multiple choice questions designed to assess applicants' theoretical knowledge and numerical understanding; we allow candidates 3 hours to complete the CBT. The second element is the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (the 'OSCE') which is a practical simulated assessment of the applicants' practical skills and knowledge. The OSCE comprises 10 stations, with a total testing time of approximately 3 hours.  For further information about the Test of Competence, please visit our website:  Test of Competence 2021 - The Nursing and Midwifery Council (https://www.nmc.org.uk/).   \nThe Supplier is required to maintain, review develop test content for the following tests of competence: \n(a)\tA modular test of competence for nurses who trained outside the United Kingdom and whose qualifications have not been assessed as comparable to a qualification awarded in the UK, or who have previously been registered but who do not meet our standards for readmission. The test must comprise of a CBT and an OSCE. Separate tests of competence must be designed for applicants to all four fields of the nursing profession, namely: \n•\tAdult nursing; \n•\tChildren's nursing; \n•\tMental health nursing; \n•\tLearning disability nursing;\n(b)\tA modular test of competence for those applying to the nursing associate part of the register who trained outside England and whose qualifications have not been assessed as comparable to a qualification awarded in England, or who have previously been registered but who do not meet our standards for readmission. The test must comprise of a CBT and an OSCE. \n(c)\tA modular test of competence for midwives who trained outside the United Kingdom and whose qualifications have not been assessed as comparable to a qualification awarded in the UK, or who have previously been registered but who do not meet our standards for readmission. The test must comprise a CBT and an OSCE. \n(d)\tAn aptitude test for nurses, midwives and nursing associates who trained within the EU or EEA and applied to NMC before 1 January 2021, where shortfalls have been identified between their qualification and a qualification awarded in the UK. The aptitude test must be designed so that applicants can be tested by taking all or part of the test of competence for nurses, midwives or nursing associates who trained outside the EU or EEA (see above). The need for this aptitude test is subject to the continued applicability of the Recognition of Qualifications Directive [2005/36/EC]. To note, the number of candidates who take the aptitude test is small compared to the number of overseas candidates who take the test of competence.\nFor more information about this tender opportunity, visit the Atamis e-Sourcing portal at the below link:\nResponses to the ITT are to be completed electronically using the NMC's e-sourcing portal https://nmcprocurementportal.force.com/s/Welcome ('e-Sourcing Portal')\nThe e-Sourcing Portal provides a web-based tool that enables the NMC and candidates and tenderers to conduct the strategic activities of the procurement lifecycle over the internet.

This presents an exciting opportunity for a suitably experienced and innovative partner to enter into a joint venture (\"JV\") with Manchester Met to realise its ambitions for the EISC. At this point in the process, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic in respect of the form which the JV will take (e.g. contractual/incorporated), and is therefore interested to hear bidders’ proposals on this aspect later in the process.  The JV Partner will be responsible for the operational running of the EISC, delivering programmes, promoting the EISC, recruitment of international students, administration of admissions and provide teaching services within the EISC.",

            "description": "Manchester Met’s vision is to collaborate with a JV Partner to create a fully embedded EISC on campus which provides pathway programmes for international students progressing onto Manchester Met degree courses. The EISC will support the University's ambition to significantly increase the number of international students enrolling on Manchester Met degree courses.To achieve this vision, it is envisaged that the EISC will: -be established in partnership with a private provider/partner; -be managed by Manchester Met and the Partner; -be physically embedded on Manchester Met’s campus; and -be established such that the EISC students will have appropriate rights and access to the University's facilities (e.g., library, laboratories, studios, classrooms and accommodation It is envisaged that in the short to medium term the EISC will be based in either existing University facilities or in leased space close to the campus. Led by the growth prospects of the JV, longer term purpose built/renovated facilities will be provided to accommodate such growth on or near to campus. It is intended that the relationship will facilitate a successful collaboration between the two entities, creating a true partnership with the shared ambition of maximising the success of the EISC. To realise this, the parties will enter into a JV following contract award – the form of which will be discussed during the procurement process. As explained above, Manchester Met wishes to remain agnostic at this point in respect of whether the JV will be based on a contractual or incorporated model. Therefore, to assist bidders in their assessment of this opportunity, Manchester Met has provided a document which lists its ‘key commercial principles’ upon which this arrangement will be based (a copy of which is provided in the procurement documents, available via the Portal). What will the JV Partner bring? Expertise in successfully delivering embedded colleges for other further education institutions and the drive, determination and innovation to ensure that the EISC is at the forefront of the international student market.  What will Manchester Met bring? The facilities required to operate the EISC, support the JV Partner to maximise its success and aims to create a true partnership which optimises the benefits for both parties. The first stage of this process requires bidders to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\u008fSQ\u008f), a copy of which is provided via the Portal. This will enable Manchester Met to identify providers who have the requisite level of experience in delivering similar projects, and the required levels of capability to deliver the EISC. Key areas of importance which will be assessed throughout the process include facilitating a supportive environment for students which maximises their educational success, academic experience, marketing of the EISC, increasing the number of international students who will eventually enrol for degree courses at Manchester Met, realising social value, IT/Systems maturity and facilitating innovation throughout the lifetime of the contract.  Following the evaluation of all SQ responses, Manchester Met intends to identify a maximum of 5 bidders to invite to the invitation to negotiate (ITN) stage of the procurement process. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated and the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. Those 5 bidders will be invited to submit initial tenders which will be evaluated by Manchester Met with the top 3 scoring bidders invited to take part in the negotiation phase. At this stage Manchester Met intends to undertake the negotiation phase such that areas for negotiation are focussed, in accordance with its ambition to undertake an efficient but fair and robust process.  A copy of the procurement pack which provides further information about this opportunity is available for download via the Portal.",

            "description": "Academy trustees have a huge opportunity to make a positive impact on children and young people’s futures by supporting academy trusts to be high quality through effective and robust governance. Academy trust boards need skilled trustees to uphold the charitable objects of the trust, oversee the strategic direction, and hold the executive to account for educational performance, and financial and risk management. Academy trust governance is modelled on charitable company governance, and boards need volunteers with the expertise and commitment required for effective governance of large charitable organisations. \n The contractor will recruit academy trustees, including chairs of trustees, onto academy trust boards that have been identified by Department for Education (DfE) Regional Directors’ teams. These will be academy trusts that are experiencing significant challenges with financial or educational performance and need additional experienced, high calibre individuals to join the board and improve the governance of the trust.   \nThe successful contractor will also promote awareness of the role of academy trustee to target audiences to increase the supply of volunteers for trustee vacancies more broadly. This activity will be complemented by DfE communications and stakeholder engagement activity. \nThis procurement is subject to financial business planning, and the DfE reserves the right to not procure the services outlined below following the conclusion of this review. \n\n          \nIt is expected that the contractor will, as a minimum, need to:   \n•\tIdentify and recruit suitable, high calibre, skilled volunteers in England who have the commitment to serve on academy trust boards, whilst prioritising support to those boards most in need, in areas of the country where capacity is weakest. \n•\tEnsure the volunteer pool is wide enough to support academy trusts in securing diversity of their boards. Trusts of a religious nature may need to recruit people who meet certain faith requirements. \n•\tEnsure that volunteers understand the roles and responsibilities of a trustee, and the time commitment required, particularly in academy trusts experiencing significant financial/educational challenges, in advance of their accepting a position on a board. \n•\tWork effectively with DfE Regional Directors’ teams who will identify boards where academy trustees are most needed and put forward those volunteers with the relevant and desirable skills, knowledge, and characteristics to support boards with the challenges they face. \n•\tProvide high quality induction support to all academy trustees recruited through this funded recruitment service. \n•\tWork with stakeholders, employers, and sector bodies to promote and raise awareness of the role of trusteeship to target audiences.\n•\tCollect and report on specified management information data, undertake self-evaluation, and build in continuous improvement throughout the contract lifetime to ensure that findings are fed into delivery on an ongoing basis.\nIndicative Timeline  \nThe DfE will be hosting online market engagement events to summarise the requirement and provide an opportunity for the DfE to test our broader questions around delivery and feasibility. Your organisation can choose to attend either of the following dates:\n23rd February 16:00 – 17:00\n28th February 14:15 – 15:15\nPlease register your interest in attending one of the events via the DfE e-Tendering portal Jaggaer, http://education.app.jaggaer.com, by completing the Market Engagement – Expression of Interest form (Ref – ssq_351), no later than 1pm on 21 February. \nOnce your organisation has expressed their interest in the opportunity, event details and joining instructions will be issued.\nThe procurement is anticipated to be launched later in Spring 2023 with contracts being awarded in Summer 2023, with a view to delivering in Autumn 2023. More information on the procurement process will be provided following market engagement through the ITT.

It should be aimed at businesses looking to increase their ability to cope with a changing business environment, including rising costs, and identify the right opportunities to develop to grow the business.\nThe programme should combine using a range of tools  and techniques with  expert support, and be tailored to participants, facilitating them to create a practical and deliverable approach to driving growth and sustainability in their business.\nThe programme should  include the following key stages: exploration of current performance and evaluation of opportunities, identification of development priorities for selected opportunities, scoping requirement, confirming strategy and identification of further support for development\nBy the end of the programme participants should have defined the capabilities, capacity and resources needed to develop opportunities and build resilience,  and be clear on their next steps to deliver.  This will be supported by a 3-month review of progress and ongoing Business Gateway adviser support.\nWhere a requirement for additional expert advice of more than half a day on a topic covered by this framework is identified during the Intensive Growth Programme, a referral should be made via Business Gateway to  the appointed supplier on the framework for that topic.",

        "description": "Her Majesty’s Prison & Probation Service (HMPPS) is an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), commissioning and providing offender management services in the community and in custody, whilst ensuring the best value for money from public resources. This encompasses three operational arms; Prisons, Probation and Youth Custody Service. Through HMPPS we are accountable for how young and adult offenders are managed in England and Wales. \nThe management of offenders within prisons is undertaken by over 30,000 personnel responsible for the management of the prison environment and offenders. The cornerstone of the service we provide is the role of the prison officer. Prison officers’ interaction with offenders and the skills and behaviours they use in facing the challenges of the prison environment are key to delivering our offender management services, including rehabilitation.\nThe aim of this scheme is to recruit a diverse cohort of talented graduates into Prison Officer roles, whilst giving them additional training and development in the form of a master’s level 7 qualification or equivalent, that enables them to bring about positive change at the front line. The long-term aim is that these graduates will remain operational within HMPPS and go on to become future leaders. \nThe new national Graduate Prison Officer Scheme will recruit high potential graduates into Prison Officer roles. During the scheme, participants must complete the Prison Officer Entry Level Training within the first 2 months and then go on to complete a level 7 qualification alongside working full time as a prison officer. \nHMPPS is looking for a Supplier who is able to recruit, train, support and retain the graduates for the duration of the scheme and give them the skills to progress their career within the service. HMPPS is open to the supplier subcontracting any of these elements to ensure effective delivery of the scheme. \nHMPPS is flexible in its approach to the delivery of the scheme but in partnership with HMPPS the supplier must;\n1.\tCreate a name and brand for the scheme that is clearly aligned with HMPPS, with the agreement that HMMPS will own this brand at contract end\n2.\tDesign, gain accreditation and deliver a level 7 qualification, focusing on leadership in a custodial environment\n3.\tCreate an innovative and engaging development programme which incorporates the required elements of the mandatory Prison Officer Entry Level Training\n4.\tCreate a support system for participants\n5.\tBuild relationships with host prisons\n6.\tCreate a structured post scheme career pathway and alumni network\nThere is a contract in place which is delivering the current graduate scheme which is due to end in Oct 2026 with a final cohort starting in Sep 2024. Our aim is to ensure we continue recruiting prison officers in a graduate development scheme from Sep 2025. We aim to recruit another 3 cohorts and maybe extend by a further 2, but are still scoping out our specification.",

These workers will support front line police officers in decision making (upskilling) around Domestic Abuse perpetrators.\n2.\tCARA Delivery - provide resources to work with the Hampton Trust to deliver Project CARA across Cheshire as an intervention for domestic abuse offenders, both male and female who have received a Conditional Caution (soon to be Diversionary Caution).\nThe PCC has submitted a grant application to the Home Office to secure funds to deliver this programme in Cheshire. The submission deadline for the application is 17th February 2023. It is expected a decision on the application will be made by 31st March 2023. In the event we are not successful in our grant application for funding, a contract will not be awarded as a result of this procurement process.\nDue to the sensitive nature of this work, inherent risks working with perpetrators of domestic abuse and the requirement to have appropriately trained and skilled staff available in short timescales, we expect the successful bidder will have some existing links to the Cheshire and North West area. We would also expect they have extensive experience in this area; in safeguarding requirements and will have a proven track record in delivering successful outcomes.\nThe proposed budget for this initial programme (3-year term) is £1.45m.\nIt is expected that the PCC will be able to put a further grant application into the Home Office for a continuation of the funding after the 3 years.
